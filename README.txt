Welcome to the my own portfolio source page! :)

This page can send your messages to me, but I don't public it on my site. Created just for fun :)

There is the next user stories:

+ User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

+ User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

+ User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

+ User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Created with bootstrap, font awesome, love and ECMAScript.
